# saveDforest Documentation
This repository contains [technical documentation](https://ricardosantosfc.github.io/savedforest-documentation/savedforest_documentation.pdf) for the web-app that supports the 'saveDforest' (v1) game - a browser based, serious game for promoting environmentally sustainable behaviors through empathy. 

While the game itself was built with Unity, the web-app that supports it is based on a MEAN stack.
